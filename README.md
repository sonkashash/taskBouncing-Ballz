# Task Bouncing-Ballz

## Description 
Develop a web application using html5 canvas, where users can click on the screen to spawn a circle. This circle should realistically obey Earth-like gravity, moving vertically and bouncing upon hitting the bottom of the screen, with a dampening effect on each bounce until it comes to a stop. There can be multiple circle instances on screen at a time.
